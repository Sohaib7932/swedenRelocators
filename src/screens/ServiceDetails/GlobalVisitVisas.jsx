                            Resident (NHR) program is especially appealing, with
                            significant tax breaks for up to 10 years on foreign
                            income and some local income exemptions.

                            programs, while Greece offers international

                            <br /> Greece is known for its rich cultural
                            heritage, Mediterranean climate, and active social
                            life. Basic Greek can be beneficial, though English
                            is commonly used in tourist and business settings.
                            Portugal, with its scenic beauty and mild weather,
                            offers a relaxed lifestyle where English is widely
                            spoken, especially in urban centers.
